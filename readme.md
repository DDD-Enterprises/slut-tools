# 💦 `slut-tools` — Command Line Kinkware

_Merge it. Lick it. Pipe it raw._

**`slut-tools`** is a dark-mode-optimized, kink-positive CLI suite designed to fuse, filter, and fuck with your markdown and plaintext files—ethically, consensually, and with style.

From `slutgasm` to future utilities like `filthlint`, `teasepipe`, and `domdiff`, this is your terminal's after-hours companion. Clean UX. Dirty intent.

## 🧠 Philosophy

We believe CLIs should be:

- Fun, flirty, and fully featured.
- Fast and filthy, without the guilt.
- Sassy, scriptable, and scandalously useful.

---

## ⚠️ Warnings

- No kink without clarity: use `-h` if you’re confused.
- Don’t run `slutgasm` in your system root unless you’re *really* ready.
- Filth is context-aware. Don’t assume. Ask.
